## Developing

### Set up

This is no different than other Rust projects.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/zama-ai/kms
cd kms
cargo test --lib
```
Use `cargo test --lib` instead to avoid running integration tests if needed.

### Useful Commands

- Build and run release version:

  ```shell
  cargo build --release && cargo run --release
  ```

- Run Clippy:

  ```shell
  cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features --workspace
  ```

- Run all tests:

  ```shell
  cargo test --all-features --workspace
  ```

- Check to see if there are code formatting issues. Be sure to have the latest stable version of rustc installed.

  ```shell
  cargo fmt --all -- --check
  ```

- Format the code in the project

  ```shell
  cargo fmt --all
  ```
