# Ethereum IPSC

The ethereum inclusion proof smart contract implements the logic for verifying
merkle proofs for ethereum blockchain.

Currently, only merkle proof is only mathematically verified. The merkle root is
assumed to be correct.Mechanism to verify the merkle root will be implemented
later.

# Deploying the etherem-ipsc smart contract

This contract has to be used in conjunction with the ASC smart contract. Refer
to the [REAMDE.md](../asc/README.md) for ASC (application specific smart
contract) for steps to build and deploy ethereum-ipsc.
