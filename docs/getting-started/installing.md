# Installation

There are basically two ways to install and use our KMS:
- the first one is, by far, the simplest: one can use our KMS, combined with fhevm, directly installed & managed by Zama in ZWS
- the second one is on-prem installation: here, power-users can install KMS on their own infrastructure

More information are given about how to use in [this part of the documentation](../guides/saas_usage.md). For what's related to on-prem installation, the reader is referred to [this section](../guides/on_prem_installation.md).
