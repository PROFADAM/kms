# Introduction

KMS stands for Key Management System. KMS is a cryptographic system using Multi Party Computation (MPC) to allow:
- key generation
- (threshold) decryption
- (threshold) decryption then reencryption.

More information about MPC and threshold cryptography are given in [this file](../explanations/threshold_cryptography.md) as well as in our [whitepaper](https://github.com/zama-ai/kms-whitepaper/releases/download/2024-09-11_06-45-46/main.pdf).
