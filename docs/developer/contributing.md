# Contributing

There are three ways to contribute to KMS:

- You can open issues to report bugs and typos and to suggest ideas.
- You can become an official contributor but you need to sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on your first contribution. Our CLA-bot will guide you through the process when you will open a Pull Request on Github.
- You can also provide new tutorials or use-cases, showing what can be done with the library. The more examples we have, the better and clearer it is for the other users.

FIXME: add more explanation about the minimal things external developer need to do (like, SW conventions, making PR, conventional commits etc).
