# KMS blockchain blocks

In our KMS, we have several blocks:
- the [connectors](../explanations/connector.md), which make the link between the KMS blockchain and the MPC nodes.
- the [nodes](../explanations/node.md), which perform the heavy MPC computations.
- the [keychain DA](../explanations/keychain.md), which stores public material constructed by the KMS.
