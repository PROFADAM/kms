# KMS blockchain blocks

In our KMS, we have several blocks:
- the [smart contracts](../explanations/smart_contract.md), which allow the configuration of the system
- the [connectors](../explanations/connector.md), which make the link between the KMS blockchain and the MPC nodes
- the [nodes](../explanations/node.md), which perform the heavy MPC computations
